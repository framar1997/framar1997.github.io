I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Statistics at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). Before landing in Bologna, I completed my PhD in Methodological Statistics at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). Along the way, I spent time at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) of [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) in Boston and at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) in Basel, working on projects related to clinical trial methodologies.

My research interests include adaptive experimental designs, Bayesian thinking, and hybrid Bayesian–frequentist methods.

In everyday life, I’m a full-time optimizer, always improving routines from my morning breakfast to grocery runs. When I’m not fine-tuning, you’ll find me caring for my plants, hunting for vintage treasures at flea markets, cooking for loved ones, or working out like a total badass.
